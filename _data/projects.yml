    A virtual assistant for physicians

    At the core of the solution is a sophisticated microservice cluster. This exposes a REST API for the front-end clients to build on top of.
    On the back-end, several different services are tied together into a processing pipeline, that can take text-based requests, run NLU processing to determine the user's intent,
    run through a sophisticated mapping engine that combines the intent with the user's current context to determine the appropriate action, and then execute that action.
    The service also manages client sessions, providing context management, inter-client communication (event bus), and several other services.
