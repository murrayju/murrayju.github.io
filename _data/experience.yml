    CSD - Custom Solutions Development
  description: |
    On the CSD team, I was responsible for working on projects that did not fit into any of the product teams' roadmaps. This included one-off customer requests, as well as building several new products from scratch. As a senior member of the team, I also acted in an advisory role on projects developed by other team members.

    Getting things done with software
  description: |
    Originally created as a personal tool when working as a service tech in high school, Temp File Cleaner grew into a product with global reach. This was an active side project of mine for many years, doing business as Addpcs LLC. In recent years, activity has slowed and I've focused on other things. The product is still being offered but is in maintenance mode with no new development.
